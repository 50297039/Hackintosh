# Hackintosh_EFI

This is my personal Hackintosh repo. 
The current config is using [Clover](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/releases). I tend to stay on the newest version. Everything is working perfectly and I have no problems.
I am planning on migrating to [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases) once it matures a bit. Currently I do not see the benefit of doing so **On my current setup**. 

**You can use this as a guide, but please, always make sure to change the UUID and Serial to something unique to your setup.**
**You should never use config.plist you find on github as is!**
